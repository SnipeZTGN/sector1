                    <p class="two" style="font-family:verdana;">The two authors and editors of all the current blogs are known to us as Alfio Laguza and Mason Potts (although Alfio likes to be called Alfie). They are both creative young people who study at Patrician Brother's College Fairfield, who enjoy coding, gaming and sports. Although Mason is a lot better at coding than Alfie, thanks to his uncle, this is both our first OFFICIAL website. With the many difficulties that we have both encountered, we have taken a leap over them, and have succeeded. This website is a great step for us, and believe that we have both completed a fascinating, interesting and fun website that all people, young and old, will enjoy!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We have currently completed the documentation side of things towards the website and the video game. These include the website structure and the storyboard. We have been discussing the colours that will be used on website and we have decided upon a colour code of gold/yellow, black and white. We are perfecting the website to appeal our preferred audience. We have finished all of Part A of our assignment which include most of the documentation, storyboarding and planning.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">Alfie Laguzza has just started on the lucid chart which is a set layout of our HTML website.Mason is doing the finishing touches of the storyboard which has brief description of our game called sector 1.Mason Potts and I are discussing little feature to put in our HTML website and game to make it look better, but we might leave it as it is just because we don't want to change to much.The reason why we don't want to change to much is because it will not match the plot of the game which really leaves your audience clueless.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We have just finished the HTML website of what both Alfie Laguza and Mason Potts have been working on. The coding throughout the website allows us to both interact with the video game and many of the webpages throughout the website. Mason Potts has nearly completed an unbelievable game that we are implementing into our website called Sector 1. We have both finished the storyboard describing what the game is going to be abut and how its going to turn out.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">Mason Potts and I are doing the final changes on our newly website that is about to blow your mind. Mason Potts has finished designing the game and we have discussed lots thing that could work together. Mason Potts has started the game. The game will be known as Sector 1. UPDATE: We have decided that the game will no longer be 8-bit but will still be a 2D platformer game. We have added to the html and CSS website and I Alfie laguzza has recieved experience from Mason Potts to add some coding to make our website more professional.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We have a pretty good idea of the Sci-Fi game that we are creating. Mason has came up with a name that fits well with topic choice of Sci-Fi. The game will be called Sector 1.This is an 8 bit game based off the popular Sci-fi game, Warframe. It will include all sorts of different weapons and enemies across multiple levels, although without all the gore.I have started the gantt chart describing the things that we have done and how long did it take to do it.Mason Potts has just started the project proposal which is a document outlining the things we have done on our website and game creation.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We received the assignment on 24th of March the topic was on multimedia website design. Our chosen topic for the assignment is Sci-Fi. This would try and recreate the world of Sci-Fi video games, as the amount of users are declining within the Sci-Fi community. Sci-Fi in my opinion has brought all joy in the world with big hit movies and games.Mason Potts: Is coding the website,Creating Project Proposal,Creating The Game.Alfie Laguzza: Designing Website,Gantt Chart,Website Blog,Information For Website,Designing The Game.</p>
