# sector1
Sector 1 is offline, free to play, website based game. Through the apocolypse, you travel as your character, fighting off the Prime Eyes falling from the sky. As you travel through, you will level up, and your score will increase, but the higher you are, the more dangerous and prone to danger you will become. Defeat all the Prime Eyes, survive the longest, and be a hero that you once were, long before the collapse of the earth. Players take on the role of the Hero, earth's last hope for humanity, and level after level, fight off the swarm of Prime Eyes, which have invaded the earth. They rain from the sky, but you wield a powerful weapon, one only you have, and you annihilate the remains of this tribe, saving yourself and others from the monstrosity.
